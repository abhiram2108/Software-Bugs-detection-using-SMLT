# Software-Bugs-detection-using-SMLT
In this project, we are going to find whether our software is buggy or not with the best accuracy using machine learning techniques. In this project, we will be having 4 modules. In these modules,  we will be doing data pre processing, data visualization, and other two modules about implementing the algorithms.
